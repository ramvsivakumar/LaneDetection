# LaneDetection


Lane Detection using Hough Transformation.

The edges of the input frames are captured using Canny Edge Detector. The edges within ROI are converted into Hough Space using Open-CV library. The slope and intercepts of hough lines are calculated are lines are drawn based on these values.
